# A Simple Django Web App for Disease Prediction

This is a simple web application built using Django, which offers two prediction tools:
- **Diabetes Prediction**: A predictor for diabetes based on various user inputs.
- **Breast Cancer Prediction**: A predictor to help detect the likelihood of breast cancer.

## Features
- Clean and minimalistic user interface using Bootstrap 5.
- Disease prediction models for diabetes and breast cancer.
- Customizable theme (light/dark mode).
- Fully responsive design.

## Purpose
I created this project for practice purposes to improve my skills in Django, frontend development, and integrating machine learning models in web applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
- Bootstrap 5 for UI
- Machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn for the prediction models
